# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Reading along: roles per token on the Bridge (`server/roles.py`, one table of which role may send which message types). Besides the peer token (`bridge.token`, unchanged) an observer token that may only read: `observe` (a copy of every message the Bridge stores), `history_all` (all conversations, with a required time window and limit, pages via `before`), `list_peers`, `ping`; it cannot register, send or hold a name. The Bridge knows it only by its SHA-256 (new required key `bridge.observer_token_sha256`, `""` on machines without the Bridge); the token is in `~/.config/ai-connect/observer.token`. `installer.py observer-token` writes both and adds deny rules for the file and for running `observer_client` to `~/.claude/settings.json`; a fresh `--server` install does it by itself. Existing Bridge machines: run it once and restart the Bridge
- `observer_client`: connection (`history`, `peers`, live `observed`), conversation tree as data (`tree.py`, a conversation is the sorted pair of its peers) and a terminal program (`python -m observer_client.cli tree|live`)

- `AI_CONNECT_PEER_SUFFIX`: the STDIO client joins as `Host:Project-Suffix`, so a second session in the same project (e.g. a reviewer started by Agent-Orc) is reachable under its own name instead of pushing the first onto standby. `AI_CONNECT_PEER_NAME` still takes precedence

### Changed
- A connection may send only the message types of its role; anything else gets an error instead of being ignored
- `bridge_time.py`: the Bridge timestamp format in one place (store, MCP tools, watcher, observer)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-10-04

### Changed
- The watcher starts by itself: the plugin runs it as an `asyncRewake` hook at session start and after every turn, and its exit wakes the session. Sessions no longer start and restart it (the rule and the 110-minute limit are gone). One watcher per session (the Bridge turns away a second), a message that arrived while no watcher ran is reported at once (`peer_read` records the read state), and it reconnects after a Bridge restart. The watcher hooks set a 7-day timeout: Claude Code ends asyncRewake hooks after its default 600 s otherwise, which left idle sessions deaf after ten minutes

### Fixed
- A watcher outlived its session (Windows does not end the process tree of hooks, and the VS Code extension briefly starts a second session); it now checks every 30 s whether its session still runs and ends otherwise. At start the client removes the name and read-state files of sessions that no longer run
- `peer_read` during standby says so and to try again in a few seconds, instead of "Not connected"

## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-04

### Added
- Release workflow: a tag `v*` builds a GitHub release with two downloads from the same code, `AI-Connect-<tag>-linux.tar.gz` and `AI-Connect-<tag>-windows.zip` (CRLF for `.cmd`/`.ps1`, without developer files such as `.github/`)
- Claude Code plugin `ai-connect@ai-connect` (`integrations/claude-code/plugin/`, the repository is its local marketplace) with the state hooks. It does not ship the MCP server, whose Python path differs between Linux and Windows; the installer registers that
- `peer_name.py`: one naming rule for the STDIO client and the watcher (project from `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` when Claude Code sets it). The client records its name per session (`~/.config/ai-connect/sessions/<pid>`), the watcher looks it up by `CLAUDE_PID`, so it no longer reads `/proc` and works on Windows too
- `installer.py`: the platform-independent installation steps (write and check the config, generate or ask for the token, register MCP server and plugin with Claude Code, remove them again), used by `install.sh` and the Windows installer
- Peer state and status line: `peer_set_status` (one line on the current work) and `peer_set_state` (busy / idle / waiting, reported by hooks; for Claude Code `mcp_tool` hooks on UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse, Notification and Stop); `peer_list` shows both. `peer_notify_when_idle` asks the Bridge for one message as soon as a peer is done or waits for an approval, across machines. The client resends state and status after every reconnect
- Bridge token: the Bridge refuses every connection whose handshake lacks `Authorization: Bearer <bridge.token>` (clients, HTTP/SSE server and watcher send it). `install.sh` generates the token on the Bridge machine and asks for it on clients. New required key `bridge.token`; a refused client stops reconnecting and `peer_status` says why
- The Bridge deletes messages older than `bridge.history_days` from the history, at start and then daily. New required config keys `bridge.history_days` and `logging.*`: add them to existing configs (see `config.yaml.example`)
- The rules make every Claude Code session keep its watcher running from the start, so messages wake the recipient without the user prompting it; the tool descriptions carry the exact watcher command of the installation
- `requirements.txt` as the single list of dependencies; `install.sh` installs from it (`aiosqlite` was missing, the Bridge crashed on fresh machines)
- `config_loader.py`: one config loader for the Bridge and both MCP clients

### Changed
- No blocking wait any more: the `/ai-connect:consult` command and the `peer_wait` tool are removed. Sessions send, end their turn and are woken by the watcher; `peer_notify_when_idle` tells them when a partner is done. The "second opinion" guidance moved into the behaviour rules
- Windows installer `install.cmd` / `install.ps1`, tested on Windows 11 (client and server): the same modes as `install.sh`; services as scheduled tasks (start at logon, no console window, restart on failure, as the user); tasks and the firewall rule for port 9999 (private networks only) need administrator rights, so the script restarts itself elevated through UAC. Clients on the Bridge machine connect to 127.0.0.1 when `bridge.host` is 0.0.0.0, which Windows refuses as a target
- The watcher's "no peer name" error says to restart the session (or reconnect `ai-connect` in `/mcp`) after an update, because the running MCP client records its name only at start
- `install.sh` reworked: `--client` installs venv, config and the Claude Code registration only, with no service and no sudo; `--server` adds the Bridge service; `--http` adds the HTTP/SSE service for other MCP clients (was installed on every machine)
- The Bridge also logs to a rotated `bridge.log`, and it stops on SIGTERM/SIGINT through `signal.signal`, which Windows supports too
- The watcher command in the tool descriptions is quoted with forward slashes, so it runs in the Git Bash that Claude Code uses on Windows
- A missing config file or key stops every service with a message; the silent defaults (including a hard-coded Bridge IP) are gone
- Code, log messages, tool descriptions and `install.sh` are in English; `install.sh` writes the PolicyKit rule for the installing user instead of a fixed one, asks clients for the Bridge address and suggests `0.0.0.0` as the Bridge's listen address (`127.0.0.1` locked out every other machine); it ends with the ready `claude mcp add` line
- `/beratung` renamed to `/consult` and rewritten in English, as are the Claude Code rules and the integration README; tag `[WEITER]` is now `[CONTINUE]`
- README (EN/DE) rewritten: setup via `install.sh`, Claude Code via the STDIO client, current architecture diagram, corrected heartbeat timings
- README (EN/DE): AI-Connect works across people, accounts and subscriptions; comparison with Claude Code's built-in cross-session messaging; security note (no authentication or encryption: LAN or VPN only); the limitation "no way to signal a running session from outside" is outdated since Claude Code's per-session inbox socket
- Logs of the MCP clients are rotated by size (`logging.max_megabytes`, `logging.backup_count`); each STDIO client writes its own `mcp-<Host>_<Project>.log` instead of all sessions sharing `mcp.log` (a rotated file must have a single writer, and the shared file did not show which session wrote a line)

### Fixed
- On Windows the watcher crashed on characters outside the ANSI code page (an arrow, an emoji), and umlauts arrived garbled; watcher output, log files, config and session files now use UTF-8
- `install.sh --update` installed the newest fastmcp (4.0.10), which broke `ai-connect-mcp.service` (ImportError); `requirements.txt` pins `fastmcp>=2.14,<3`
- A session replaced by a newer one with the same name stayed offline for good, even after the newer one had left (2026-10-04: a short second instance of the archimedes-lander session left the running one unreachable); it now waits on standby (`register` with `standby`, Bridge answers `standby` and later `name_free`) and takes the name back. Both sessions get a notice from `Bridge`
- The watcher read the Bridge's database file and therefore worked on the Bridge machine only; it now asks the Bridge over the network (`watch`, no registration) and works on every machine, pushed instead of polling every 5 s
- `peer_send` with a file and `peer_context` sent only the path and line numbers; the file content (or the given lines) now travels with the message
- `peer_history` showed only the local, already emptied queue; it now asks the Bridge
- A broadcast to offline peers was handed to whichever peer came online first and marked delivered (possibly back to its sender); broadcasts now reach the peers online at that moment
- A client that could not reach the Bridge at start never retried; it now reconnects in the background
- The Bridge refreshed a peer's heartbeat whenever it sent to it, so silent peers never timed out; only the peer's own pings count now
- `register` without a name is rejected instead of registering `None`
- The HTTP/SSE server had its own copy of every tool and lacked `peer_wait`; both servers now share `client/mcp_app.py`

### Removed
- `chat_viewer.py`: it registered as an ordinary peer and therefore never saw the messages it promised to show
- `peer.auto_connect`: with `false` the client stayed disconnected for good
- The "Salomo Principle" (AIfred/Sokrates/Salomo roles, 2/3 voting) from docs and command: nothing in AI-Connect implemented it
- `pyproject.toml`: unused, its entry point named a module that does not exist

## [Unreleased] - 2026-09-28

### Added
- `integrations/claude-code/aiconnect_watch.py`: message watcher that wakes a Claude Code session via a finished background task instead of polling
- Waiting rules in `integrations/claude-code/CLAUDE.md` and in the `peer_read`/`peer_wait` tool descriptions

### Changed
- `aiconnect_watch.py` takes the peer name from the session's MCP client instead of the shell's current directory, prints it at start and exits with an error when it cannot tell (a watcher started from a worktree listened for the wrong name)
- A second session with the same peer name takes over; the Bridge sends the older one `replaced` and it stops reconnecting (was: the two pushed each other out every ~27 s)
- Docs: peer names are `Host:Project`; `/advisor` skill replaced by the `/beratung` command (now `/consult`)

### Fixed
- Duplicate entries in the client's peer list after re-registrations
- The client noticed a clean close by the Bridge only at the next ping (25 s)
- ruff/mypy findings in client and server

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-03

### Added
- Multi-agent communication via MCP bridge
- SSE transport for stable Claude Code connections
- Salomo Principle for multi-agent consensus (AIfred/Sokrates/Salomo)
- `/advisor` skill for polling mode
- Offline message storage with SQLite
- Project-based peer names (e.g., "Aragon (myproject)")
- Unique client IDs with PID suffix for multiple instances
- Install script with server/client modes
- English and German documentation

### Architecture
- Bridge Server (WebSocket, port 9999) - routes messages between peers
- MCP HTTP Server (SSE, port 9998) - local interface for Claude Code
- Persistent WebSocket connections with heartbeat
