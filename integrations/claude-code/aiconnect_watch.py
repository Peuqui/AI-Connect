"""Wake the Claude Code session when an AI-Connect message for it arrives.

The AI-Connect plugin starts this as an asyncRewake hook at session start
and after every turn: when it exits with code 2, Claude Code wakes the
session and shows it what this script printed. It asks the Bridge to be told
about messages for the session's peer, without registering as that peer, so
it cannot take over the name. While it waits it costs nothing: the Bridge
pushes, nothing polls.

- One watcher per session: the Bridge turns away a second one, which then
  exits quietly (code 0).
- A message that came after the session last read (peer_read), while no
  watcher ran, is reported at once.
- When the Bridge goes away (a restart), it reconnects by itself.

Exit codes: 2 = message (wakes the session), 0 = another watcher runs,
1 = error.
